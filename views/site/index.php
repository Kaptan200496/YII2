                <h2>Goalkeepers</h2>

                <p>Clean were few and far between on Matchday 3 as this round of fixtures featured the fewest shut-outs of the current UEFA Champions League campaign. Only six sides kept their opponents at bay and Paris are now the only team remaining who are yet to concede a goal in the competition – good news for owners of Keylor Navas (€5.5m) with the Costa Rican shot-stopper sitting on 18 #UCLfantasy points. However, this is not quite enough for top spot in the ranks as Dortmund's Roman Bürki (€5.5m) reigns supreme on 20 points, thanks in large part to his penalty save against Internazionale on Wednesday.

Overall, there have been 26 clean sheets across the first three matchdays, with an even distribution of 13 being kept at home and 13 away. There have been an increasing number of goals scored each matchday and with the business end of the group stage fast approaching, this trend could continue as teams fight to remain in the competition. Therefore, clean sheets may become even rarer as we progress, but it is notable that the top point-scoring goalkeepers are dominated by those who play for European heavyweights, with the likes of Manchester City's Ederson (€6.0m), Ajax keeper André Onana (€5.0m) and Atlético No1 Jan Oblak (€6.0m) all producing good returns so far..</p>

                <h2>football stars</h2>

                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have plenty of records already, but there are a few more targets to aim for. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's ongoing battle to be the top goalscorer in European football remains perhaps the sport's greatest drama of our age, but both still need to raise their game considerably if they are to scoop certain European Champion Clubs' Cup and UEFA Champions League records.

Messi became the first player to score in 15 consecutive UEFA Champions League campaigns (group stage to final) after he registered against Slavia Praha on Matchday 3, while Ronaldo set another record on 12 March when he became (at 34 years and 35 days) the oldest player to score a UEFA Champions League hat-trick, in a 3-0 Juventus win against Atlético Madrid. Can either of them break the following records?</p>
